## About

Potion Shopkeeper is an adorable 3D game made in Unity where you play as an owner of a small potion shop! The idea of the game comes from my love for relaxing simulation games such as Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing. The goal of the game is to make enough money within 10 days to purchase an incredibly rare potion ingredient called 'The Heart of the Wild.' The game is meant to be relaxing with some element of thought and strategy put into it. 
## Controls

- WASD - movement
- E - interact with table/cash register/ cauldron / Fred
- I - potion inventory
- MB1 (Left Click) - Icon drag and drop

## Features

**Your shop's necessities:**

- **Cauldron** - craft potions and discover new recipes through experimentation with ingredients
- **Table** - drag a potion into the slot, set a price, and click the Display button to put a potion up for sale!
- **Fred** - unlock new ingredients to be able to brew a wider variety of potions. 
- **Cash Register** - process a transaction with a customer waiting in line

**Experiment with new recipes at the cauldron in order to unlock better and more expensive potions to sell!**

**Understand how to price a specific potion by observing a customer's reaction to the price!** <br/>
Reactions:
- Too cheap = Excited (+1 reputation)
- Good Price = Satisfied (+0.5 reputation)
- Bit too pricey = Upset (-1 reputation)
- Way too expensive = Angry (-2 reputation)

**Reputation affects your shop popularity. The higher the more customers!**

NOTE: Potion recipes are based off ingredient COLOR. For example  to make Health Potion I, you need 1 Red and 3 White ingredients.
